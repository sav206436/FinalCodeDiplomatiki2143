The final code of my project about my Master's thesis titled 'Efarmoges Technikon Michanikis Mathisis se Dedomena Grafon', 2143.
It's an example using the MovieLens 100K database, after the necessary imports, transforms and merges, first we do exploratory data analysis, then we create a heterogeneous bidirectional graph, then we train a supervised machine learning model using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) collaborative filtering known as Graph-Based Collaborative Filtering.
Runs in Python 3.9.
Savvas.
